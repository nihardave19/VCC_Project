# ML-Project - Online Payment Fraud Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based online payment fraud detection system that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. By leveraging historical transaction data, we aim to train models that can generalize well to new, unseen data.
